# sign-up-form

A template sign-up form I created. This project was intended to practice some of my CSS using positioning, opacity, line/letter height, and styling in general. In addition, I just learned how to create forms w/ various inputs and wanted to give it a go. This project was done through collaboration with The Odin Project.
